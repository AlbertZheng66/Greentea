 I believe that the best and efficient way to access the capability of a software engineer is to read his source code, so I put my work here, which is written on my spare time.

I am passionate about programming and spend countless weekends on improving programming skills and learning the fundamental theories of information technology.

I guess that there are some points that I should point out in advance. 

<UL>
<LI>First, the projects were started several years ago, which means that they would not completely represent my levels now. I have been learning new tricks and programming languages continually. However, I hope that it would help you know me better. 
</LI>
</br>
<LI>Second, they are not only &quot;for-fun&quot;
projects but practical work. Most of the open source projects were contributed to my previous companies and are applied in various projects.

Third, I do not have enough time to translate the Chinese comments to English. Sorry for the inconvenience.

<H3> OVERVIEW </H3>
<DIV>
	This is my first open source framework and components lib and all my other projects are based on this one. Then, I was tortured by the SSH framework stack, which is, in my own opinion, really hard to maintain and lacks flexibility. So I developed this framework to reduce couple points in configuration files. I would say that the idea more or less resembles the principle of RubyOnRail--&quot;Convention over configuration&quot;. 
</DIV>

</br>
<DIV>
	What I would like to emphasize is that it has the ability to adapt to different types of clients. I have used JSP, Swing and pure JavaScript as clients. I am happy to say that this framework is still used in various projects.
